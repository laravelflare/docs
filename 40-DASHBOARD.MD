# Dashboard

The Flare Dashboard is the default view when you visit the admin panel. It can
be used to provide an overview of your applications data in the form of widgets.

Out of the box the dashboard will auto populate itself with default widgets 
that are automatically generated based on each `ModelAdmin` class you define.

The dashboard is completely customizeable and the default implementation can
either be expanded on or replaced based on your usage requirements, through the 
use of a custom widgets and/or custom views.
